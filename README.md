# HallPass


This project was created in a 30-hour BCIT hackathon event and recieved 3rd prize. It is a web based map interface that displays 
relavant student resource locations. For instance it can show the user where microwaves are located on campus. The full
implementation of the project was not possible given the time limit. Myself and 4 others were randomly selected to be in a group
to solve an everyday problem of students. This was the basis of Hallpasses creation. we find that campuses have become so large that
students have difficulty adjusting to new buildings and the familiarization process is inconvienient. Visitors may have a hard time
navigating upon graduation ceremonies or work oppurtunities as well. This is where HallPass comes into effect.

Our group went through an initial brainstorming process where we came up with several ideas, Michael Anderson suggested a resource map
and we decided to go ahead with the design process in agreement that this was an everyday problem that an application would be fitting to
solve. We overviewed the general design into three initial steps, an area map with a menu to choose which resource to show, a pop-up for
every building on the map to show the resources, and the final step a secondary pop-up to show more detailed information about the resource.
We delegated roles and did hourly check-ins to keep up with the process and inform each other of problems and areas which needed more
attention than others. Overall the process took around 11 hours with presentation practice included. We presented to 2 BCIT professors, an
industry professional, and the event organizer.

In the future, HallPass could evolve into an all-purpose companion app that could be integrated into learning management systems such as
D2L, Lon-Capa, etc. Having a one-stop shop for all a student needs would be the end goal. Integration into Google Maps API would also
be a consideration to make.

The interface as of the moment utilizes HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery and has an unintegrated JSON aspect that would allow for global updates
of icons and number of resources.
